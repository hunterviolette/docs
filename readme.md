## [Chemical Process Simulator](https://github.com/hunterviolette/24spring/tree/simulator)
Simulate flows through stoichiometric reactors, separators, and electrolyzers with inputs, recycles, 
and dependent-flow streams. Converge flows to steady-state and steady-state set-point. Overall 
steady-state material balance. Perform thermodynamic calculations of temperature and pressure dependent 
mixtures using equations of state to calculate heat of reaction and overall heat duty for adiabatic 
operation of reactors

Develop, simulate, and optimize [chemical processes](https://github.com/hunterviolette/24spring/blob/main/che_capstone/assets/pfd.png) by creating [configuration files](https://github.com/hunterviolette/24spring/blob/main/che_capstone/configs/ammonia_electrosynthesis.json) that outline the execution order and conditions of reaction and separation units operations to analyze chemical processes 
-	Retrieve chemical property data from [ChemPy](https://pythonhosted.org/chempy/).
-	Obtain thermodynamic property data and perform thermodynamic computations utilizing [cubic equations of state](https://thermo.readthedocs.io/thermo.eos_mix.html#redlich-kwong-equation-of-state) for single and multi-component mixtures from [Thermo](https://thermo.readthedocs.io/).
-	Iterate through [unit operations](https://github.com/hunterviolette/24spring/blob/main/che_capstone/assets/sim_pfd.png) in process to determine the input and output flow rates.
-	Iterate through entire process multiple times for steady-state analysis
