## [Chemical Process Simulator](https://github.com/hunterviolette/24spring/tree/main/che_capstone)
Simulate flows through stoichiometric reactors, separators, and electrolyzers with inputs, recycles, 
and dependent-flow streams. Converge flows to steady-state and steady-state set-point. Overall 
steady-state material balance. Perform thermodynamic calculations of temperature and pressure dependent 
mixtures using equations of state to calculate heat of reaction and overall heat duty for adiabatic 
operation of reactors.
